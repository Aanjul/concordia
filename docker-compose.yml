### Before running any Compose services, make sure you have an .env file
# inside your current folder and that it has been populated with the following content:
#   CONCORDIA_ADMIN_PW=<concordia-admin-pw>
#   POSTGRESQL_PW=<postgres-pw>
#   EMAIL_HOST=<your_smtp_email_host_here>
#   EMAIL_HOST_USER=<your_smtp_email_host_user_here>
#   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<your_smtp_email_host_password_here>
#   DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<your_email_from_address_here>



### Start Docker containers with the following command :
#  sudo make up

### Create grafana user and assign the grafana admin password.
#  with docker-compose running, in a separate terminal window, enter the following commands:
#
#  sudo docker exec -it concordia_grafana bash -c "./setup.sh/grafana_post_run.sh"
