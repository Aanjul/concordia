Passwords
=============

This project stores passwords in a file named .env. This file resides in the root directory of the concordia app and 
it is not included in the source code respository.

You must be create this file in the concordia root directory.

This file contains three values, which are:
::    

    GRAFANA_ADMIN_PW=<grafana_admin_password_here>
    CONCORDIA_ADMIN_PW=<concordia_admin_password_here>
    POSTGRESQL_PW=<postgresql_concordia_user_password_here>

Replace each <.._password_here> above with your actual password.

The script to create the concordia admin user uses the value matching CONCORDIA_ADMIN_PW as the "admin" user password.

The postgresql concordia database is accessed using the username concordia and the password specified by POSTGRESQL_PW.
The django concordia app uses the POSTGRESQL_PW value to connect to the concordia database running in the db docker
container. 

The value for GRAFANA_ADMIN_PW is used to login to grafana using the admin user.

Setting the passwords in this file is the only location where user passwords are defined. All access to these passwords
is through the .env file. 

An example of a .env file is in the top level source directory, it is called "example_env_file".

Running Concordia
=================

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia.git
    $ cd concordia
    $ docker-compose up

Browse to `localhost <http://localhost>`_


Development Environment
=======================

You may wish to run the Django development server on your localhost instead of
within a Docker container. It is easy to set up a Python virtual environment to
work in.


Serve
-----

Instead of doing ``docker-compose up`` as above, instead do the following::

    $ docker-compose up -d db
    $ docker-compose up -d rabbit

This will keep the database in its container for convenience.

Next, set up a Python virtual environment, install pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/>, and other Python prerequisites::


    $ python3 -m venv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ pip3 install pipenv
    $ pipenv install --system --dev --deploy


Finally, configure the Django settings, run migrations, and launch the development server::

    $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = "concordia.settings_dev"
    $ ./manage.py migrate
    $ ./manage.py runserver


Code Quality
------------

Install black <https://pypi.org/project/black/> and integrate it with your editor of choice.
Run flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/> to ensure you don't increase the warning count or introduce errors with your commits.
This project uses EditorConfig <https://editorconfig.org> for code consistency.

Django projects should extend the standard Django settings model for project configuration. Django projects should also make use of the Django test framework for unit tests.

setup.cfg contains configuration for pycodestyle, isort <https://pypi.org/project/isort/> and flake8.

Unify â€“ modifies strings to use consistent quote style
https://pypi.org/project/unify/

The virtual env directory should be named .venv and it's preferred to use Pipenv to manage the virtual environment.

Configure your editor to run black, isort, and unify on each file at save time. 
If you can't modify your editor, here is how to run the code quality tools manually::

    $ black .
    $ isort --recursive .
    $ unify --in-place *.py && unify --in-place **/*.py


Misc
----

To generate a model graph, do::

    $ docker-compose up -d app
    $ docker-compose exec app bash
    # cd concordia/static/img
    # python3 ./manage.py graph_models concordia > tx.dot
    # dot -Tsvg tx.dot -o tx.svg
