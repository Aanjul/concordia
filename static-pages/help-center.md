# FAQ

### What is Make Your Mark and what is crowdsourcing?

Make Your Mark is an online transcription platform where anyone with an internet connection can transcribe documents from the Library of Congress’ digitized collections. We welcome anyone interested in making non-machine readable resources fully word searchable to contribute.

Crowdsourcing invites members of the public, non-specialists and specialists alike, to help make data more usable and discoverable. Crowdsourcing at the Library of Congress invites volunteers to explore collections while gaining new skills, for example, learning to read older forms of handwriting such as cursive.

### Who can take part?

Anyone who wants to help the Library make its collections more discoverable online. Anyone who is interested in history, cultural heritage, literature, languages, art, sciences, and much more. Anyone who wants to be a virtual volunteer, exploring collections and transcribing at their own pace and at times that are convenient for them. Students of all ages who want to help the Library and learn new skills.

### How do volunteers work together?

You'll collaborate with other volunteers to transcribe and review collections. We ask for at least one person to transcribe and a different person to review each transcription. If you find that a transcription needs a few corrections while you're reviewing, you can edit that page. Another person will then review your new edits. Sometimes more than one person will contribute to transcribe an image; such as if you find an image with a transcription that needs more work. We think of this negotiated editing process as a way to get the best version of a transcription and help solve different challenges for each image.

### What kinds of materials can I transcribe?

Materials in Make Your Mark represent the diversity of the Library’s collections and are selected from across the Library of Congress’s curatorial divisions. You’ll encounter presidential papers, materials from the women's suffrage, abolition and other movements, the work of American poets, such as Walt Whitman, and much more. We will add new content regularly: [sign up for our newsletter](https://updates.loc.gov/accounts/USLOC/subscriber/new?topic_id=USLOC_175) to hear about new Campaigns and Challenges.

### How do I know if I’m transcribing, tagging or reviewing correctly?

For a detailed description of how to transcribe, review, tag, and more read the [Long Form Instructions link] available on the transcription page. Remember, our goal is to make transcriptions that are readable to computers and humans, with minimal markup, not attempting to recreate the layout of the original images.

### Do I have to register for an account?

Registering for an account is optional, but gives you access to the tagging and reviewing features of Make Your Mark. Go to Register at the top of the homepage to make an account. Create a username, which will be visible to other volunteers and users of the site. Enter your email address in the “Email” field (this will not be visible to or shared with other users), and in the password field create a unique password with a combination of capital and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters such as #, $, !, or %.

### What if I forget my password?

If you've forgotten your password click Login, then "Forgot my password". You will receive an email with a link asking you to reset your password. You may also change your password within your profile.

### Why do we ask for your email?

Your email address gives us the ability to support you. Community managers are here to help with account administration like changes to your profile, troubleshooting any issues with contributing to a transcription, or to answer general questions. We will never share your information with other institutions or individuals. At registration you can opt in to receive email updates on Make Your Mark campaigns and features – you can also [register for emails from us here](https://updates.loc.gov/accounts/USLOC/subscriber/new?topic_id=USLOC_175).

### How will the transcriptions I create be used?

The data contributed by volunteers like you can be used in many different ways. We are giving back to our community by making this data public. All contributions to this application are released into the public domain. Anyone is free to use this data set in any way they want. The data produced by volunteers is also free to reuse. If you need help accessing the data or want to share news of your research with the Make Your Mark community, please contact the Community Managers at [crowd@loc.gov](mailto:crowd@loc.gov).

### What are tags for?

Tags are an experimental feature. Tags can be used to identify people, places or things in documents that are not already identified in the page or asset’s metadata on [loc.gov](https//:loc.gov). We want to understand how volunteers like to use tags. We also want to understand whether tags can someday be included in the metadata on the Library catalog to make items discoverable through search terms that are not represented in the existing metadata or the transcriptions we will produce on Make Your Mark.

### What if I find offensive content while I’m transcribing and reviewing?

The language and terminology used in the historical materials on this site reflect the context and culture of their creators, and may include words, phrases, and attitudes that would now be deemed insensitive, inappropriate or factually inaccurate, or may not be appropriate for all ages. Views expressed in historical documents do not reflect the views of the Library of Congress. Because the purpose of Make Your Mark is to make the Library’s collections searchable, we ask that all original content be transcribed as it appears in the original material. If you find some material offensive or upsetting, please choose something else to transcribe. If you have questions or comments regarding the material you encounter during your participation here, please contact a Community Manager via [crowd@loc.gov](mailto:crowd@loc.gov), the [“Contact Us"](/contact-us/) or join and start a new conversation on the [History Hub discussion forum](https://historyhub.history.gov/community/make-your-mark/).

### What devices and browsers are supported by Make Your Mark?

Because Make York Mark invites you to transcribe documents, it is best experienced on a device with a large or full sized keyboard. A desktop computer or laptop is best; a tablet with keyboard should work. Unfortunately, phones are not yet supported. We recommend an external mouse for most precise zoom. We support the two most recent versions of major browsers. You’ll have the best experience if you use Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari browsers. The site will not work as designed on the Internet Explorer browser.

### What is the technology behind Make Your Mark?

Make Your Mark runs on Concordia, new open source software developed by the Library of Congress to power crowdsourced transcription projects. The code is visible and free to reuse: [Visit our Github repository](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia) for more information. The platform was built utilizing user-centered design principles based around building trust and approachability. This project is a partnership between the Library and a growing community of volunteers who help us to iteratively improve the platform. Everyone is welcome to take part in transcription and tagging and to give feedback about how we can improve the code base and the project itself. Be in touch!

### How do you protect my privacy?

A detailed explanation of the Library’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.loc.gov/legal/) including what kinds of data we collect and store, and what we use to track your session while you are on a Library website is available at this link, and in the footer of this page under the “Legal” link button.

You do not have to register an account on Make Your Mark in order to transcribe, but you can register if you would like to review or tag. In order to make sure a transcription is submitted by a real human, anonymous users will be prompted to fill in a captcha before their first submission will be accepted. The Library’s captcha is an image of a few letters and numbers that you need to transcribe into the box below the image.

A session cookie will be used in your browser while you are transcribing so that you do not need to enter a captcha every time you work on a page. Session cookies are limited to 24 hours, so you will be prompted to enter a captcha as you transcribe anonymously more than (X AMOUNT OF TIME) after your last submission.

Session cookies are used for registered users too, so that your contributions can be saved to your account. Check out your user profile to see how many pages you have transcribed, tagged and reviewed.

### What are past crowdsourcing projects at the Library?

The Library of Congress has long invested in building digitized collections and making them searchable. The Library’s first attempt recruiting members of the public to increase findability on our website began in 2008 when the Photography and Prints Division published thousands of photographs on [Flickr Commons](https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress). This long-running project invites visitors to help identify people and places in the photographs and, once verified, this rich information is used to enhance the online catalog and improve access for all users. Two additional crowdsourcing efforts within the Library include [Roll the Credits](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sroosa/roll-the-credits) and [Beyond Words](http://beyondwords.labs.loc.gov/), projects that invited people to transcribe credit captions from television programs, and identify cartoons and photographs in the Library's historic newspaper collections respectively.

### Do other libraries and cultural institutions have crowdsourcing projects?

In addition to the Library of Congress’ own history of varied participatory projects, other cultural heritage institutions with established transcription programs have paved the way for Make Your Mark. Projects at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Smithsonian, the New York Public Library, Zooniverse.org, From the Page, and others have developed workflows and user engagement strategies that this platform leverages and builds upon. Concordia deploys a different architecture to these existing models of crowdsourced transcription, and aims to provide simple data structures and easier project implementation for cultural heritage institutions and other people who want to set up their own crowdsourced transcription projects.
