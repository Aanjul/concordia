      Crowdsourcing invites members of the public, non-specialists and specialists alike, to help make data more usable and discoverable. Crowdsourcing at the Library of Congress invites unpaid volunteers to explore collections while gaining new skills, for example, learning to read older forms of handwriting such as cursive.

       You'll collaborate with other volunteers to transcribe and review collections. We ask for at least one person to transcribe and a different person to review each transcription. If you find that a transcription needs a few corrections while you're reviewing, you can edit that page. Another person will then review your new edits. Sometimes more than one person will contribute to transcribe an image; such as if you find an image with a transcription that needs more work. We think of this negotiated editing process as a way to get the best version of a transcription and help solve different challenges for each image.

The data contributed by volunteers like you can be used in many different ways. We are giving back to our community by making this data public. All contributions to this application are released into the public domain. Anyone is free to use this data set in any way they want. The data produced by volunteers is also free to reuse. If you need help accessing the data or want to share news of your research with the crowd.loc.gov community, please contact the Community Managers at <a href="mailto:crowd@loc.gov">crowd@loc.gov</a>. The transcriptions produced on crowd.loc.gov will typically be published in the Library catalog on loc.gov within a year of a Campaign's completion.

 Tags are an experimental feature. Tags can be used to identify people, places or things in documents that are not already identified in the page or asset’s metadata on <a href="https://loc.gov">loc.gov</a>. We want to understand how volunteers like to use tags. We also want to understand whether tags can someday be included in the metadata on the Library catalog to make items discoverable through search terms that are not represented in the existing metadata or the transcriptions we will produce on crowd.loc.gov.

The language and terminology used in the historical materials on this site reflect the context and culture of their creators, and may include words, phrases, and attitudes that would now be deemed insensitive, inappropriate or factually inaccurate, or may not be appropriate for all ages. Views expressed in historical documents do not reflect the views of the Library of Congress. Because the purpose of crowd.loc.gov is to make the Library’s collections searchable, we ask that all original content be transcribed as it appears in the original material. If you find some material offensive or upsetting, please choose something else to transcribe.

Because Make York Mark invites you to transcribe documents, it is best experienced on a device with a large or full sized keyboard. A desktop computer or laptop is best; a tablet with keyboard should work. Unfortunately, phones are not yet supported. We recommend an external mouse for most precise zoom. We support the two most recent versions of major browsers. You’ll have the best experience if you use Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari browsers. The site will not work as designed on the Internet Explorer browser.

crowd.loc.gov runs on Concordia, new open source software developed by the Library of Congress to power crowd.loc.govsourced transcription projects. The code is visible and free to reuse: <a href="https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia">Visit our Github repository</a> for more information. The platform was built utilizing user-centered design principles based around building trust and approachability. This project is a partnership between the Library and a growing community of volunteers who help us to iteratively improve the platform. Everyone is welcome to take part in transcription and tagging and to give feedback about how we can improve the code base and the project itself. Be in touch!

A detailed explanation of the Library’s <a href="https://www.loc.gov/legal/">Privacy Policy</a> including what kinds of data we collect and store, and what we use to track your session while you are on a Library website is available at this link, and in the footer of this page under the “Legal” link button.
</p>
<p>
You do not have to register an account on crowd.loc.gov in order to transcribe, but you can register if you would like to review or tag. In order to make sure a transcription is submitted by a real human, anonymous users will be prompted to fill in a captcha before their first submission will be accepted. The Library’s captcha is an image of a few letters and numbers that you need to transcribe into the box below the image.
</p>
<p>
A session cookie will be used in your browser while you are transcribing so that you do not need to enter a captcha every time you work on a page. Session cookies for anonymous users are limited to 24 hours, so you will only be prompted to enter a captcha once a session.
</p>
<p>
Session cookies are used for registered users too, so that your contributions can be saved to your account. Check out your user profile to see how many pages you have transcribed, tagged and reviewed. Registered user session cookies last two weeks.

The Library of Congress has long invested in building digitized collections and making them searchable. The Library’s first attempt recruiting members of the public to increase findability on our website began in 2008 when the Photography and Prints Division published thousands of photographs on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress">Flickr Commons</a>. This long-running project invites visitors to help identify people and places in the photographs and, once verified, this rich information is used to enhance the online catalog and improve access for all users. Two additional crowdsourcing efforts within the Library include <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sroosa/roll-the-credits">Roll the Credits</a> and <a href="http://beyondwords.labs.loc.gov/">Beyond Words</a>, projects that invited people to transcribe credit captions from television programs, and identify cartoons and photographs in the Library's historic newspaper collections respectively.

In addition to the Library of Congress’ own history of varied participatory projects, other cultural heritage institutions with established transcription programs have paved the way for crowd.loc.gov. Projects at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Smithsonian, the New York Public Library, Zooniverse.org, From the Page, and others have developed workflows and user engagement strategies that this platform leverages and builds upon. Concordia deploys a different architecture to these existing models of crowd.loc.govsourced transcription, and aims to provide simple data structures and easier project implementation for cultural heritage institutions and other people who want to set up their own crowd.loc.govsourced transcription projects.
