In addition to transcribing, you can review and edit transcriptions created by your fellow volunteers. A reviewer’s task is to read the entire transcription and carefully compare it against the image of the document. If you want to become a reviewer, please register an account.

While reviewing, you can change a transcription to fix errors or add missing material. Remember, do not edit the spelling and grammar of the original document, but do correct any spelling errors or misreadings created by the transcriber. When you’re done, click the "Save" and "Submit" buttons. The page will then need to be reviewed by another volunteer and will only be completed when a volunteer clicks "Approve" without making changes.
