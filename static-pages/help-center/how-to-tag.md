title: How to Tag


You can  use tags however you like, so long as you avoid using offensive, degrading or hurtful language about other individuals or groups of people. Read the Library’s commenting policy here. Here are some ways you might consider tagging:



If you transcribe an important word in a document, such as somebody’s name, and the original author spelled the name incorrectly, add a tag with the correct spelling.

Sometimes writers use nicknames or code words. If you can correctly identify the full name or subject add a tag. 

Are you interested in documents mentioning cats? Use the “Tag” button to tag all pages that mention cats. Other examples include “Civil War”, “Cooking”, “Sports”. You can apply whatever tags you like.

Keep tags as short as you can and use whole words instead of abbreviations. This will make it easier for other people to understand and use your tags.

Tagging is an experimental feature. Tags might one day go back into the Library catalog website, but for now they will only be used by volunteers to explore items within Make Your Mark.
