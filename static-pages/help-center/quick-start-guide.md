title: Quick Start Guide

1. Welcome to Make Your Mark! Our goal is to make documents word-searchable in the Library of Congress catalog. Help us transcribe original items, many of which have never been transcribed before. Anyone can transcribe, you don’t need an account, but registered volunteers can access the review and tag features [insert link to registration page]. You can choose which tasks you want to do, and what pages you want to work on.

2. Transcribe what you can into the white box on the right. Transcribe lines in the order they appear and preserve line breaks. This will make the transcriptions useful for researchers. If you see multiple pages, such as an open notebook with two pages, just transcribe in the order you would read the text.

3. Don’t reproduce features such as underlining, bold text, line breaks or indentation in your transcription. Only words will be searchable in these transcriptions--not formatting. See the “Instructions” tab (at bottom of page) for more information.

4. Click “Save” as you go to save your work in progress. Always click “Save” before you move from transcribing to tagging.

5. Click “Submit” when you are done transcribing and are ready to move on to the next page or to reviewing or tagging.

6. You can explore collections by clicking the “Campaigns” button at the top of the screen or by scrolling to the bottom of the home page and selecting a Campaign. 

7. Registered volunteers can review other people’s transcriptions. To start reviewing pages, select a page and click an item with the “Review” icon [image/hover]. Read a page carefully and decide if the transcription looks correct. When a transcription is accurate and you do not need to make any changes, click the [I'm Done?] button. The page will now be marked as complete. If you need to make changes start editing the page, click “Save” periodically, and then click “Submit”. Changes you submit will be reviewed by another volunteer. You cannot review your own work. This process continues until someone marks a page as “Done” without making changes.

8. If you have a question or comment about how Make Your Mark works, or about a Campaign, item or page, connect with the Make Your Mark team and other volunteers on History Hub [link], a public online forum where everyone can join in the discussion.
