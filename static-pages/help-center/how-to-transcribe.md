title: How to transcribe

We transcribe to improve search functionality. Our goal is to make documents word-searchable in the Library of Congress catalog, which means typing transcriptions that can be read by that computer system, as well as by humans. Most handwriting and even some typed text cannot be automatically and accurately translated into machine-readable text using current technologies -- that’s why we need your help!.

We ask you to transcribe a document the same way you would read it aloud. We are not trying to recreate the appearance of the words on the original pages. The completed transcripts will be viewable beside the original images in the catalog, ensuring the physical layout of the page will always be available to readers.

### Making sense:

Transcribe a page in the order it makes the most sense to read it. So, even if a “P.S.” (postscript) in a letter is written at the top of the paper because the author ran out of space at the bottom, transcribe the P.S. at the end.

### Spelling:

Preserve original spelling unless the author seems to have made a minor error, such as writing “teh” instead of “the”. If a misspelling will impact the searchability of the document, use a tag to add the correct spelling. Example:

- An author wrote “Willa Kather” when writing about “Willa Cather”. Transcribe Willa Kather, and tag “Willa Cather”.

### Insertions:

When text has been inserted or added later, but should be read as part of a sentence, type it in the order you would read it aloud.

### Line-breaks:

Do not reproduce dashes indicating words broken between two lines. Write library rather than li-brary, kitten rather than kit-ten.

### Emphasis:

The Library catalog cannot search for bold, italic, underlined or superscript text, so even when you see these features please transcribe the words without any styling.

### Illegible:

Illegible text is anything you can’t read because a page is damaged, text is heavily crossed out or you can’t tell what the author has written. If there is a word or a string of words you cannot read use a pair of square brackets around an empty space [ ]. Example:

- "I have [ ] loved coffee ice cream"

If you can read any letters or parts of words transcribe what you can and use question marks for the remaining letters or words. Examples:

- "I have [a?????] loved coffee ice cream"
- "I have [a?] loved coffee ice cream"

If you cannot read a word or phrase that’s ok. Another volunteer may be able to identify the missing letters and update your transcription. If there is a lot of text you cannot read consider looking for another page that you can decipher better.

### Deletions:

If you can read crossed out or otherwise deleted text, transcribe the deleted words within a pair of square brackets. Example:

- “I have always loved [vanilla] coffee ice cream.”

### Marginalia:

Marginalia is text written in the white space around the main block of text. It usually is a comment on the main body text but can also be unrelated. It is different from an insertion because it cannot be directly inserted into the main text and still make sense when read aloud. Use a pair of square brackets and asterisk (\*)around marginalia text and order it within the transcription where it makes the most sense (or at the end of the transcription if it appears unrelated). Example:

- I have always loved coffee ice cream. Last summer I made my own using a recipe from the 1970s. It was the creamiest coffee ice cream I ever ate. No one else in my family likes that flavor. Oh well, more for me! [*Brazil was the largest coffee producing country in the world in 2017*]

### Printed and typed text:

Some material in Make Your Mark was created on a typewriter or printed. If we have included it here it is because the text is not machine-readable. A computer using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology cannot create an accurate word-searchable transcription.

### When not to transcribe printed text:

Some calendars and diaries contain many pages of pre-printed almanacs or other text that is probably machine-readable and therefore should not be transcribed as part of this project.
