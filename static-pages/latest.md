# Letters to Lincoln Challenge 
## Help us transcribe 30,000+ pages of the Abraham Lincoln Papers by the end of 2018!

We’re welcoming you to crowd.loc.gov with a grand challenge. You might guess that Abraham Lincoln Papers include materials written in his own hand, but did you know the collection contains correspondence sent to Abraham Lincoln throughout his life and political career? 

Here's a taste of what  A range of materials by writers ranging from friends and associates from Lincoln’s Springfield days, well-known political figures and reformers, constituents writing to their President, and even the occasional document in Lincoln's own hand - read the concerns and requests of 19th century Americans and international correspondents. 

### So, what’s the challenge? 
Our first challenge milestone is completion of all the material in the first two Campaign projects: "1830-1839, first forays in politics and law" and "1840-1849, marriage, election to Congress" by November 1. Can you transcribe even just one letter and share the challenge with one friend to help push toward our goal?  When the project completes we’ll move onto the next exciting decade of Lincoln's life, the 1850s when he returned to politics.

### Aren’t these already transcribed? 
Yes, around half of the digitized Abraham Lincoln Papers, primarily materials written by Lincoln, have been transcribed by other volunteers at Knox College and elsewhere, and are already keyword searchable at loc.gov. However, there remain 10,000+ items including letters and other materials sent to him that are not yet keyword searchable. Completing the Letters to Lincoln Challenge will make all of the digital Lincoln Papers word-searchable and accessible to future readers. Just imagine the possiblities--from new research to local connections--that will be possible once we've achieved this goal. Thank you in advance for sharing your time with us. Your Community Managers, reference librarians and curatorial staff here at the Library of Congress will be cheering you on with bonus historical context and resources all along the way, as well as some special rewards for goals met!
