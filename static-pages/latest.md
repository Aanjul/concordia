### Help us transcribe 10,000+ items from the Abraham Lincoln Papers by the end of 2018!

#### A grand challenge: why we're asking you to join us
Around half of the digitized Abraham Lincoln Papers, primarily materials written by Lincoln, have been transcribed by other volunteers at Knox College and elsewhere, and are already keyword searchable at loc.gov. However, there remain 10,000+ items including letters and other materials sent to him that are not yet keyword searchable. Completing the [Letters to Lincoln Challenge](https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns/letters-to-lincoln/) will make all of the digital Lincoln Papers word-searchable and accessible to future readers. Just imagine the possibilities--from new research to local connections--that will be possible once we've achieved this goal. Thank you in advance for sharing your time with us. Your Community Managers, reference librarians and curatorial staff here at the Library of Congress will be cheering you on with bonus historical context and resources all along the way, as well as some special rewards for goals met!

#### So, what’s the challenge? 
Our first milestone was completion of all the material in the first three Campaign projects: "1830-1839, first forays in politics and law," "1840-1849, marriage, election to Congress," and "1850-1857: death and birth of children, and re-entry to politics" by November 1st. Our next *updated* challenge to you is to transcribe and review all 646 pages in the "1858-1859 Presidential Nomination" project by midnight on November 6th, election day! 

Can you transcribe even just one letter and share the challenge with one friend to help push toward our goal?  When the project completes we’ll move onto the next exciting decade of Lincoln's life, the 1850s when he returned to politics.

#### What are the Letters to Lincoln?
You might guess that the Abraham Lincoln Papers include materials written in his own hand, but did you know the collection contains correspondence sent to Abraham Lincoln throughout his life and political career? Here's a taste of what you'll find: a range of materials by writers ranging from friends and associates from Lincoln’s Springfield days, well-known political figures and reformers, constituents writing to their President, and even the occasional document in Lincoln's own hand. Read the concerns and requests of nineteenth-century Americans and international correspondents.
